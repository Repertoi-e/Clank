# Game of Life

For binaries go to ../bin/Win32/Release

Source code for the game is here. I used my own engine which source code you can look at ../Clank/src

Note that these projects are not cross platform and work only on Windows*
If you wish to build it yourself, use MSVC with Windows SDK installed.

* I think you can use WINE on linux to run the executables.
